      Group Sports Queue is a targeted web application, primarily designed for mobile 
      browsers, developed to efficiently manage game queues in group sports environments. 
      Conceived and built within three days, it is currently in its testing phase. The 
      application skillfully combines a Node.js and Express.js backend with RESTful APIs 
      for dynamic content and efficient data handling. The frontend, leveraging React.js 
      and asynchronous JavaScript, enhances user engagement with a draggable/droppable 
      queue feature, allowing for intuitive reordering of members. Hosted on Fly.io with 
      MongoDB Atlas Cloud supporting the backend, Group Sports Queue excels in delivering 
      real-time updates, keeping all participants synchronized. This application not only 
      simplifies the organization of sports activities but also serves as an exemplary use 
      of modern web development practices to address specific, practical needs in community 
      sports settings.
